Explination:
libsdl2-dev
Is for displaying images in a window and getting user input

libsdl2-image-dev
Makes it easier to load Images. Sdl only has a load for BMP's and this saves doing manual conversions based on type

libsqlite3-dev
Used to call SQL queryies to quows database to load the data.
Note: I just load the entire data because it is only ~13mb. Though I'm probabily doing it very inefficiently.
